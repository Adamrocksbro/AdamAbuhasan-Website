        <p class="lead mb-4">Hey, my name's Adam Abuhasan, and I'm a first-year student at the University of Riverside with a burning passion for all things cybersecurity. Let me take you on a little journey through my life and explain why I've set my sights on this exciting field.

Ever since I was a kid, I've been captivated by the world of computers and technology. I always thought it was really cool so I was that curious little guy who would spend hours tinkering with gadgets, exploring every nook and cranny to understand how they worked. As I grew older, my interest in technology evolved into a fascination with the intricate world of cybersecurity.

You see, I believe that in this digital age, protecting information and ensuring the integrity of our online systems is more important than ever. The increasing threats of cyberattacks and data breaches have motivated me to step up and contribute my skills to safeguarding our digital world. Esspicaly when currency throughout the world is becoming digital

As a first-year student, I'm just beginning to scratch the surface of this vast and ever-evolving field. So far I've enrolled in courses that Introduce me to computer science and teach me the basic fundamentals. 

Looking ahead, my goal is to continue honing my skills and knowledge in cybersecurity. I aspire to obtain industry certifications, such as the Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) or Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP), to enhance my credibility and expertise. I also plan to pursue internships and engage in real-world projects that will allow me to apply my skills and make a tangible impact.

Ultimately, my dream is to work in the field of cybersecurity, protecting critical infrastructure, ensuring data privacy, and contributing to a safer digital world. I want to be at the forefront of the battle against cyber threats, collaborating with experts from various fields to build robust defenses and develop innovative solutions.

So, that's a glimpse into my journey as a first-year student with a passion for cybersecurity. It's an exhilarating path, filled with challenges and opportun<br><br>
